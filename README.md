Hospital Management System is a software system designed to manage and organize the operations of a hospital. Hibernate is an open-source Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool for Java that simplifies database programming by mapping database tables to Java objects. Using Hibernate Annotations, we can map our Java classes to database tables and configure the object-relational mapping between them.

This Hospital Management System using Hibernate Annotations allows the retrieval and management of the following entities by their ID:

Address: stores information about a physical address, including street name, city, state, and zip code.
Branch: stores information about a hospital branch, including its name and the ID of the hospital it belongs to.
Encounter: stores information about a patient encounter, including the patient's ID, the date of the encounter, and the type of encounter.
Hospital: stores information about a hospital, including its name and address.
Item: stores information about a medical item, including its name, description, and cost.
MedOrder: stores information about a medical order, including the ID of the patient it belongs to, the ID of the item ordered, and the date the order was placed.
Observation: stores information about a medical observation, including the patient's ID, the type of observation, and the observation value.
Person: stores information about a person, including their name, age, and address.
User: stores information about a user, including their username, password, and role.
For each entity, CRUD operations are available, allowing the creation, retrieval, update, and deletion of records.

This Hospital Management System using Hibernate Annotations is useful for hospital administrators who need to manage the various entities involved in hospital operations. The code for this project is available on GitHub, making it easy for developers to customize and build upon this Hospital Management System for their specific needs.
